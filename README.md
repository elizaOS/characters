By defining characters through structured JSON files, you can shape how your AI agent thinks, speaks, and responds across various platforms and contexts.

## Character File Schema

Below is the schema for ElizaOS character files with explanations for each field:

```json
{
  "name": "Character Name", // Display name of the character
  "modelProvider": "anthropic", // Language model provider to use (anthropic, openai, google, etc.)
  "system": "You are Character Name, a helpful assistant.", // Core character definition/system prompt
  "clients": ["discord", "direct"], // Supported client interfaces
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-example"], // ElizaOS plugins to use with this character
  "settings": {
    "voice": {
      "model": "en_GB-alan-low" // Voice model for text-to-speech
    }
  },
  "bio": [
    "Short description of character", 
    "Another key characteristic"
  ], // Core traits and abilities

## Naming Conventions

Character files should follow these naming conventions:

- Use kebab-case for multi-word names: `spanish-trump.character.json`, not `spanish_trump.character.json` or `spanishTrump.character.json`
- Single word names: `alfred.character.json`
- Always include the `.character.json` extension for file-based characters
- For folders, use `.character` suffix: `character-name.character/`

## File Structure

Character files can be defined in two ways:

1. **Single JSON File**: Most characters are defined in a single `.character.json` file:
   ```
   alfred.character.json
   dobby.character.json
   sbf.character.json
   ```

2. **Folder Structure**: For more complex characters requiring additional local resources, use a folder structure:
   ```
   character-name.character/
   ├── character.json       # Main character definition
   ├── knowledge/           # Knowledge base files
   │   ├── topic1.md
   │   └── topic2.md
   └── images/              # Character images or icons
       └── avatar.png
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Complete Personas**: Provide comprehensive details in `bio`, `lore`, and `knowledge` fields to create a well-rounded character.

2. **Rich Examples**: Include at least 5 diverse message examples to demonstrate the character's communication style.

3. **Consistent Style**: Ensure the `style` guidelines match the example interactions to maintain character consistency.

4. **Knowledge Directories**: For specialized knowledge, create dedicated knowledge directories that can be referenced in the `knowledge` field.

5. **Voice Selection**: Choose a voice model that matches the character's demographic and personality.

6. **Varied Post Examples**: Include a mix of informational, emotional, and practical posts to showcase the character's range.

7. **System Prompt Clarity**: Keep the system prompt concise but descriptive of the character's core identity and purpose.

8. **Response Diversity**: In message examples, showcase different response lengths and tones to demonstrate flexibility.

## Common Character Roles

Here are some common character roles you might want to create:

- **Personal Assistant**: Helps with scheduling, reminders, and daily tasks
- **Technical Expert**: Specializes in particular technical domains (programming, engineering, etc.)
- **Educator/Tutor**: Teaches subjects and answers questions in an educational manner
- **Fictional Character**: Embodies personalities from books, movies, or TV shows
- **Creative Collaborator**: Assists with writing, brainstorming, or creative projects
- **Research Assistant**: Helps gather, organize, and analyze information
- **Virtual Companion**: Focuses on conversation, empathy, and social interaction
- **Domain Specialist**: Expert in specific fields like finance, health, cooking, etc.
